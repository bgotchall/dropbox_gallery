#some notes about this tutorial

https://dropbox.github.io/nodegallerytutorial/


I did actually unzip and drop the galleria into public.  but renamed the dir without the version.
there is also an npm install but these instructions don't address that.

the handlebars view has the version number and path problems.  Several example files had path issues.  fix those
and it seems to work ok.
